**Status**: Planned for future development

**Purpose**: This module will contain data analysis and insights generation components for the NBA play-by-play data once the scraping and database population phases are complete.

## Planned Components

### Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis of play-by-play data
- Player performance metrics calculation
- Team analytics and comparisons
- Game flow analysis and momentum tracking

### Insights Generation
- Automated report generation
- Trend identification across seasons
- Performance pattern recognition
- Clutch time analysis

### Visualization
- Chart and graph generation for statistics
- Dashboard components for web interface
- Interactive data exploration tools

## Current Status

This module is currently empty as it depends on:
1. Completion of the NBA game data scraping (Plan 08)
2. Implementation of the comprehensive database schema (Plans 09-10)
3. Population of normalized database tables (Plan 11)

The analytics components will be developed after the core data collection and storage infrastructure is fully operational.
