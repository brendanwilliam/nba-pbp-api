# Analytics Module

**Status**: Essential analytics implemented

**Purpose**: This module contains core analytical components for WNBA play-by-play data, focusing on essential tracking systems for possession and lineup analysis.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Possession Tracking (`possession_tracker.py`)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Real-time possession-by-possession analysis system that tracks:
- Possession changes and ownership
- Possession duration and efficiency
- Offensive and defensive possessions
- Shot clock tracking and resets
- Turnover analysis

**Key Features**:
- Tracks possession changes based on game events (scores, rebounds, turnovers, fouls)
- Calculates possession efficiency metrics
- Handles special cases like offensive rebounds (14-second shot clock reset)
- Provides foundation for offensive/defensive rating calculations

### 2. Lineup Tracking (`lineup_tracker.py`) 
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Real-time player on/off court tracking system that provides:
- Who is on the court at any given moment of any game
- Lineup change detection and timing
- Player substitution tracking
- Lineup combination analytics

**Key Features**:
- Tracks player entries and exits from the game
- Maintains real-time lineup state throughout games
- Enables lineup combination performance analysis
- Supports plus/minus calculations for specific lineups

## Core Analytics Philosophy

This module follows a **lean analytics approach**, focusing on fundamental basketball analysis rather than advanced statistical modeling. The emphasis is on:

1. **Data Accuracy**: Precise tracking of game state and events
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Moment-by-moment game tracking capabilities  
3. **Foundation Building**: Creating solid base metrics for further analysis
4. **WNBA Focus**: Adapted specifically for WNBA game structures and patterns

## Technical Implementation

Both tracking systems are designed to:
- Process play-by-play data in real-time or batch mode
- Maintain game state consistency across all events
- Handle edge cases and data anomalies gracefully
- Provide clean, normalized output for database storage
- Support both individual game analysis and season-wide aggregation

## Usage

These analytics components integrate directly with the WNBA scraping and database infrastructure:
- Automatically process scraped game data
- Store analytical results in the database
- Provide foundation for query-based analysis
- Support both historical and real-time game analysis
