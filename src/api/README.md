# API Module

**Status**: Planned for future development

**Purpose**: This module will contain RESTful API endpoints for querying the scraped NBA play-by-play data once the database is fully populated.

## Planned Components

### REST API Endpoints
- Query plays by team, player, game, time, date
- Filter by shot clock, score differential, game situation
- Season and playoff data access
- Real-time game data (if applicable)

### API Features
- **Authentication**: API key management and rate limiting
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large result sets
- **Filtering**: Advanced query parameters for data selection
- **Caching**: Response caching for improved performance
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Query Capabilities
- **Game Queries**: Get all plays for specific games
- **Player Queries**: Get all plays involving specific players
- **Team Queries**: Get all plays for specific teams
- **Situational Queries**: Get plays matching specific game situations
- **Time-based Queries**: Get plays within specific time ranges
- **Statistical Aggregations**: Get summary statistics

### Response Formats
- JSON (primary)
- CSV export capabilities
- XML (if needed)

## Current Status

This module is currently empty as it depends on:
1. Completion of the NBA game data scraping (Plan 08)
2. Analysis of JSON data and comprehensive database schema design (Plan 09)
3. Implementation of the complete database schema (Plan 10)
4. Population of normalized database tables with parsed data (Plan 11)

The API endpoints will be developed after the core data collection, parsing, and storage infrastructure is fully operational and the database contains a substantial amount of play-by-play data.

## Future Development Priority

This module is scheduled for development in **Plan 13: Create REST API endpoints for querying the database** after the data infrastructure is complete.
