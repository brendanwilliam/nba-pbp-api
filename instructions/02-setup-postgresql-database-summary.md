# PostgreSQL Database Setup - Summary

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Database Setup**
- PostgreSQL was already installed (version 14.18)
- Database `nba_pbp` was already created
- Merged latest changes from main branch

✅ **Dependencies Installation**
- All Python dependencies already installed via requirements.txt
- Key packages: SQLAlchemy, Alembic, psycopg2-binary, FastAPI

✅ **Environment Configuration**
- Created `.env` file based on `.env.example`
- Configured database connection for user `brendan` without password
- Database URL: `postgresql://brendan@localhost:5432/nba_pbp`

✅ **Database Schema**
- Alembic migration system already set up
- Successfully ran initial migration (e194f204963a)
- Created core tables:
  - `teams` - NBA team information
  - `games` - Game metadata and relationships
  - `players` - Player information linked to teams
  - `scrape_queue` - Tracking scraping status
  - `raw_game_data` - Storing JSON from NBA.com
  - `alembic_version` - Migration tracking

✅ **Database Testing**

- Tested SQLAlchemy session creation
- Confirmed all tables created correctly
- Database ready for data ingestion

## Database Architecture

The schema supports the full NBA data pipeline:
- **Teams/Players**: Core entities with relationships
- **Games**: Central hub linking teams, dates, and metadata
- **Scrape Queue**: Status tracking for large-scale scraping (1996-2025)
- **Raw Game Data**: JSON storage for #__NEXT_DATA__ from NBA.com pages

## Next Steps

The database is fully configured and ready for:
1. Web scraping implementation
2. Data ingestion workflows  
3. API development
4. Analytics queries

All core database infrastructure is in place to support the NBA play-by-play data API project.
