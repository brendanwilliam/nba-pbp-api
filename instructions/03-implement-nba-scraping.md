# NBA.com Scraping Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement web scraping functionality to extract NBA play-by-play data from NBA.com game pages.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Scraper Components
- **Game URL Discovery**: Scrape `nba.com/games?date={YYYY-MM-DD}` to find game URLs
- **Data Extraction**: Extract play-by-play data from `#__NEXT_DATA__` JSON in game pages
- **Queue Management**: Track scraping progress and handle large volume of games (1996-2025)

### 2. Data Models
- Extend existing models to handle scraped data
- Add scraping metadata (status, timestamps, errors)
- Queue system for managing scraping jobs

### 3. Scraper Architecture
- `GameURLScraper`: Discovers game URLs from schedule pages
- `GameDataScraper`: Extracts play-by-play data from individual games
- `ScrapingQueue`: Manages scraping jobs and status tracking
- `ScrapingManager`: Orchestrates the entire scraping process

### 4. Error Handling
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Rate limiting to respect NBA.com servers
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual scraper components
- Integration tests with mock NBA.com responses
- Test data validation and storage

## Technical Requirements
- Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- Implement respectful scraping with delays
- Handle JSON parsing from `#__NEXT_DATA__` script tags
- Store scraping metadata in database
