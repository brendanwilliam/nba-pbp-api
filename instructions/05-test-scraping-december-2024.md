# 05 - Test Scraping December 2024

## Objective
Test the NBA scraping functionality on a small batch of games from December 2024 to ensure reliability and data quality before scaling to full historical scraping.

## Background
The scraping infrastructure has been implemented but needs validation on recent games to verify:
- Scraper reliability and error handling
- Data quality and completeness
- Performance characteristics
- JSON structure consistency

## Scope
- Target: ~30 games from December 2024
- Focus: Recent completed games with full play-by-play data
- Validation: Data structure, completeness, accuracy

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Setup
1. **Identify test games**
   - Select 30 completed games from December 1-15, 2024
   - Mix of different teams, game types (regular season)
   - Include high-scoring and low-scoring games for variety

2. **Create test configuration**
   - Test-specific database tables or schema
   - Isolated scraping queue for test games
   - Logging configuration for detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Scraping Execution
1. **Run game URL collection**
   - Generate URLs for test games
   - Validate URL format and accessibility

2. **Execute scraping**
   - Run scraper on test game URLs
   - Monitor success/failure rates
   - Capture timing and performance metrics

3. **Data validation**
   - Verify JSON structure consistency
   - Check play-by-play completeness
   - Validate box score accuracy

### Phase 3: Analysis and Optimization
1. **Performance analysis**
   - Scraping speed per game
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Error rate analysis

2. **Data quality assessment**
   - Missing data identification
   - JSON structure variations
   - Edge case handling

3. **Optimization recommendations**
   - Rate limiting adjustments
   - Error handling improvements
   - Data parsing enhancements

## Success Criteria
- 95%+ successful scraping rate
- Complete play-by-play data for all successful scrapes
- Consistent JSON structure across games
- No rate limiting or blocking from NBA.com
- Performance suitable for scaling to thousands of games

## Deliverables
1. Test results summary report
2. Performance metrics and recommendations
3. Updated scraper configuration for production use
4. Documentation of any NBA.com structure changes

## Timeline
- Setup and configuration: 1 day
- Scraping execution: 1 day
- Analysis and optimization: 1 day

## Risk Mitigation
- Small batch size minimizes impact of failures
- Test on recent games to ensure current NBA.com compatibility
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Backup manual verification of sample games

## Next Steps
After successful validation:
1. Apply optimizations to scraper
2. Proceed to systematic scraping plan (Plan 06)
3. Scale to larger game batches
