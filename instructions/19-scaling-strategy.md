## Infrastructure Scaling Strategy

### Application Layer Scaling
1. **Horizontal scaling architecture**
   ```yaml
   # Kubernetes deployment configuration
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nba-api
   spec:
     replicas: 5
     strategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
       rollingUpdate:
         maxSurge: 2
         maxUnavailable: 1
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: api
           image: nba-api:latest
           resources:
             requests:
               memory: "512Mi"
               cpu: "250m"
             limits:
               memory: "1Gi"
               cpu: "500m"
           readinessProbe:
             httpGet:
               path: /health
               port: 8000
             initialDelaySeconds: 10
             periodSeconds: 5
   ---
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: nba-api-hpa
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: nba-api
     minReplicas: 5
     maxReplicas: 100
     metrics:
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: cpu
         target:
           type: Utilization
           averageUtilization: 70
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: memory
         target:
           type: Utilization
           averageUtilization: 80
   ```

2. **Microservices architecture migration**
   ```
   Service Decomposition:
   ├── API Gateway (rate limiting, auth, routing)
   ├── Games Service (game data and metadata)
   ├── Players Service (player stats and information)
   ├── Analytics Service (advanced calculations)
   ├── MCP Service (natural language processing)
   ├── Cache Service (Redis cluster)
   └── Data Pipeline Service (ETL and processing)
   
   Benefits:
   - Independent scaling per service
   - Technology diversity (Python, Go, Node.js)
   - Fault isolation and resilience
   - Specialized optimization per service
   ```

### Database Scaling Strategy
1. **Read replica architecture**
   ```sql
   -- Primary-replica setup
   Primary Database (Write operations):
   - All writes and real-time updates
   - High-performance SSD storage
   - Automatic failover capability
   
   Read Replicas (Read operations):
   - API query serving
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Regional distribution for latency
   - Load balancing across replicas
   
   Configuration:
   - 1 Primary + 3 Read Replicas (Year 1)
   - 1 Primary + 10 Read Replicas (Year 3)
   - Cross-region replicas for global access
   ```

2. **Database partitioning strategy**
   ```sql
   -- Horizontal partitioning by season
   CREATE TABLE play_events_partition (
       LIKE play_events INCLUDING ALL
   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (season_year);
   
   -- Create partitions for each season
   CREATE TABLE play_events_2024 PARTITION OF play_events_partition
       FOR VALUES FROM (2024) TO (2025);
   
   -- Benefits:
   -- - Faster queries on recent data
   -- - Parallel processing across partitions
   -- - Easier maintenance and archival
   -- - Improved cache locality
   ```

### Caching Architecture
1. **Multi-layer caching strategy**
   ```python
   class CacheManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.l1_cache = InMemoryCache(ttl=60)     # Application cache
           self.l2_cache = RedisCluster()            # Distributed cache
           self.l3_cache = CDNCache()                # Edge cache
       
       async def get(self, key: str):
           # L1: Check application memory
           value = await self.l1_cache.get(key)
           if value:
               return value
           
           # L2: Check Redis cluster
           value = await self.l2_cache.get(key)
           if value:
               await self.l1_cache.set(key, value)
               return value
           
           # L3: Check CDN cache
           value = await self.l3_cache.get(key)
           if value:
               await self.l2_cache.set(key, value)
               await self.l1_cache.set(key, value)
               return value
           
           return None
   ```

2. **Cache optimization strategies**
   ```python
   cache_strategies = {
       'static_data': {
           'ttl': 86400,  # 24 hours
           'tables': ['teams', 'players', 'seasons'],
           'strategy': 'cache_aside'
       },
       'game_data': {
           'ttl': 3600,   # 1 hour
           'tables': ['games', 'play_events'],
           'strategy': 'write_through'
       },
       'statistics': {
           'ttl': 1800,   # 30 minutes
           'computation': 'heavy',
           'strategy': 'cache_first'
       },
       'real_time': {
           'ttl': 60,     # 1 minute
           'data': 'live_scores',
           'strategy': 'refresh_ahead'
       }
   }
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization
1. **Database optimization techniques**
   ```sql
   -- Materialized views for common aggregations
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW player_season_stats AS
   SELECT 
       p.player_id,
       p.player_name,
       g.season,
       COUNT(*) as games_played,
       AVG(pgs.points) as avg_points,
       AVG(pgs.rebounds) as avg_rebounds,
       AVG(pgs.assists) as avg_assists
   FROM player_game_stats pgs
   JOIN players p ON pgs.player_id = p.player_id
   JOIN games g ON pgs.game_id = g.game_id
   GROUP BY p.player_id, p.player_name, g.season;
   
   -- Refresh strategy
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY player_season_stats;
   
   -- Composite indexes for common query patterns
   CREATE INDEX idx_games_team_season_date 
   ON games(home_team_id, season, game_date);
   
   CREATE INDEX idx_play_events_game_time 
   ON play_events(game_id, period, time_elapsed);
   ```

2. **API optimization techniques**
   ```python
   class OptimizedAPIService:
       async def get_player_stats(self, player_id: int, season: str = None):
           # Use cached materialized view for better performance
           cache_key = f"player_stats:{player_id}:{season or 'all'}"
           
           cached_result = await self.cache.get(cache_key)
           if cached_result:
               return cached_result
           
           # Optimized query using materialized view
           if season:
               query = """
               SELECT * FROM player_season_stats 
               WHERE player_id = $1 AND season = $2
               """
               params = [player_id, season]
           else:
               query = """
               SELECT player_id, player_name,
                      SUM(games_played) as total_games,
                      AVG(avg_points) as career_avg_points
               FROM player_season_stats 
               WHERE player_id = $1
               GROUP BY player_id, player_name
               """
               params = [player_id]
           
           result = await self.db.fetch(query, *params)
           await self.cache.set(cache_key, result, ttl=3600)
           return result
   ```

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
1. **Global CDN deployment**
   ```yaml
   CDN Configuration:
   - Primary: CloudFlare Enterprise
   - Regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific
   - Edge locations: 200+ globally
   - Cache hit ratio target: 85%+
   
   Cache Rules:
   - Static assets: 1 year TTL
   - API responses: 5-60 minutes TTL
   - Real-time data: No cache
   - Images/charts: 24 hours TTL
   ```

2. **Edge computing capabilities**
   ```javascript
   // CloudFlare Workers for edge processing
   addEventListener('fetch', event => {
     event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
   })
   
   async function handleRequest(request) {
     const url = new URL(request.url)
     
     // Rate limiting at edge
     if (await isRateLimited(request)) {
       return new Response('Rate limited', { status: 429 })
     }
     
     // Cache common queries at edge
     if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/teams')) {
       const cached = await CACHE.get(url.pathname)
       if (cached) {
         return new Response(cached, {
           headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
         })
       }
     }
     
     // Forward to origin
     return fetch(request)
   }
   ```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Infrastructure Cost Management
1. **Resource optimization**
   ```yaml
   Cost Optimization Strategies:
   
   Compute:
   - Spot instances for non-critical workloads (60% savings)
   - Reserved instances for predictable workloads (40% savings)
   - Auto-scaling to match demand
   - Container resource right-sizing
   
   Storage:
   - Intelligent tiering (frequently accessed data)
   - Archive old data to cheaper storage
   - Compress historical data
   - Deduplicate similar records
   
   Network:
   - CDN for reduced bandwidth costs
   - Regional data replication optimization
   - Compression for API responses
   - Efficient data serialization formats
   ```

2. **Database cost optimization**
   ```sql
   -- Data lifecycle management
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION archive_old_data()
   RETURNS void AS $$
   BEGIN
       -- Archive play events older than 10 years
       INSERT INTO play_events_archive 
       SELECT * FROM play_events 
       WHERE game_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10 years';
       
       DELETE FROM play_events 
       WHERE game_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10 years';
       
       -- Compress and optimize tables
       VACUUM ANALYZE play_events;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   
   -- Schedule regular optimization
   SELECT cron.schedule('archive-data', '0 2 * * 0', 'SELECT archive_old_data();');
   ```

### Monitoring and Cost Analytics
1. **Cost tracking and alerting**
   ```python
   class CostMonitor:
       def __init__(self):
           self.cloud_billing = CloudBillingAPI()
           self.alert_manager = AlertManager()
       
       async def monitor_costs(self):
           current_spend = await self.cloud_billing.get_current_spend()
           budget_threshold = self.get_budget_threshold()
           
           if current_spend > budget_threshold * 0.8:
               await self.alert_manager.send_alert(
                   "Cost Alert",
                   f"Current spend: ${current_spend}, "
                   f"Budget: ${budget_threshold}"
               )
           
           # Analyze cost trends
           cost_analysis = await self.analyze_cost_trends()
           await self.generate_cost_report(cost_analysis)
   ```

## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring and Observability
1. **Comprehensive monitoring stack**
   ```yaml
   Monitoring Stack:
   - Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
   - Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Tracing: Jaeger for distributed tracing
   - APM: New Relic or DataDog for application performance
   - Uptime: Pingdom for external monitoring
   
   Key Metrics:
   - Response time (p50, p95, p99)
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit ratios
   - Resource utilization
   - Business metrics (API calls, revenue)
   ```

2. **Alerting and incident response**
   ```python
   class AlertManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.notification_channels = [
               PagerDutyChannel(),
               SlackChannel(),
               EmailChannel()
           ]
       
       async def process_alert(self, alert: Alert):
           severity = self.determine_severity(alert)
           
           if severity == "critical":
               # Page on-call engineer
               await self.notify_oncall(alert)
               # Auto-scale if possible
               await self.auto_remediate(alert)
           elif severity == "warning":
               # Slack notification
               await self.notify_team(alert)
           
           # Log all alerts for analysis
           await self.log_alert(alert)
   ```

### Deployment and Release Strategy
1. **CI/CD pipeline optimization**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions workflow
   name: Deploy NBA API
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run tests
           run: |
             pytest tests/
             npm run test:integration
   
     deploy:
       needs: test
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Deploy to staging
           run: kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
         
         - name: Run smoke tests
           run: npm run test:smoke
         
         - name: Deploy to production
           if: success()
           run: |
             kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
             kubectl rollout status deployment/nba-api
   ```

2. **Blue-green deployment strategy**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Blue-green deployment script
   
   CURRENT_ENV=$(kubectl get service nba-api -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.version}')
   NEW_ENV=$([[ $CURRENT_ENV == "blue" ]] && echo "green" || echo "blue")
   
   echo "Deploying to $NEW_ENV environment..."
   
   # Deploy new version
   kubectl apply -f deployment-$NEW_ENV.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/nba-api-$NEW_ENV
   
   # Run health checks
   ./run-health-checks.sh $NEW_ENV
   
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "Health checks passed. Switching traffic..."
       kubectl patch service nba-api -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"'$NEW_ENV'"}}}'
       echo "Deployment successful!"
   else
       echo "Health checks failed. Rolling back..."
       kubectl delete deployment nba-api-$NEW_ENV
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

## Regional and Global Scaling

### Multi-Region Architecture
1. **Global deployment strategy**
   ```
   Regional Distribution:
   
   Primary Region (US-East):
   - Main database cluster
   - Primary API infrastructure
   - Data processing pipelines
   
   Secondary Regions:
   - US-West: Read replicas, CDN edge
   - Europe: Read replicas, GDPR compliance
   - Asia-Pacific: Read replicas, low latency
   
   Benefits:
   - Reduced latency for global users
   - Improved availability and fault tolerance
   - Compliance with data residency requirements
   - Load distribution across regions
   ```

2. **Data synchronization strategy**
   ```python
   class GlobalDataSync:
       def __init__(self):
           self.primary_db = DatabaseConnection("us-east-1")
           self.replicas = {
               "us-west-1": DatabaseConnection("us-west-1"),
               "eu-west-1": DatabaseConnection("eu-west-1"),
               "ap-southeast-1": DatabaseConnection("ap-southeast-1")
           }
       
       async def sync_data(self):
           # Monitor replication lag
           for region, replica in self.replicas.items():
               lag = await replica.check_replication_lag()
               if lag > 30:  # 30 seconds threshold
                   await self.alert_replication_lag(region, lag)
               
           # Sync cache across regions
           await self.sync_cache_data()
