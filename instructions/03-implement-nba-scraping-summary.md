# NBA.com Scraping Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented the NBA.com scraping functionality with the following components:

### Core Scraper Components

1. **GameURLScraper** (`src/scrapers/game_url_scraper.py`)
   - Scrapes `nba.com/games?date={YYYY-MM-DD}` to discover game URLs
   - Parses game URLs to extract team codes and game IDs
   - Handles rate limiting with configurable delays
   - Includes error handling for network issues

2. **GameDataScraper** (`src/scrapers/game_data_scraper.py`)
   - Extracts play-by-play data from individual NBA game pages
   - Parses `#__NEXT_DATA__` JSON from game pages
   - Validates game data structure
   - Extracts game metadata and play-by-play information

3. **ScrapingManager** (`src/scrapers/scraping_manager.py`)
   - Orchestrates the complete scraping process
   - Manages database operations for games and teams
   - Handles scraping queue with status tracking
   - Provides retry logic for failed scrapes
   - Offers scraping statistics and progress tracking

### Database Integration

The scraping system integrates with the existing database models:
- Uses `Game`, `Team`, `ScrapeQueue`, and `RawGameData` models
- Automatically creates team records for discovered games
- Tracks scraping status and attempts for each game
- Stores raw JSON data from NBA.com for later processing

### Comprehensive Testing

Created extensive test suite (`tests/test_scrapers.py`):
- Unit tests for individual scraper components
- Mocked HTTP requests to avoid hitting NBA.com during testing
- Integration with CSV test data (`tests/data/gameid_on_days.csv`)
- Validation tests using known game counts for specific dates
- Error handling and edge case testing

### Additional Features

- **Example Script** (`examples/scraping_demo.py`): Demonstrates scraping functionality
- **Respectful Scraping**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling for network issues and data parsing

## Key Technical Details

- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented delays between requests (1s for URL scraping, 2s for game data)
- **Data Validation**: Validates scraped data structure before storage
- **Queue Management**: Tracks scraping progress with pending/in_progress/completed/failed states
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed scrapes with configurable max attempts
- **Team Management**: Automatically creates team records when new tricodes are discovered

## Testing Results

All 13 tests pass successfully:
- 11 unit tests for core functionality
- 2 integration tests using real NBA schedule data
- Comprehensive mocking to avoid external dependencies during testing
- CSV-based validation ensures scraper finds expected game counts

The implementation provides a solid foundation for scraping NBA play-by-play data at scale while respecting NBA.com's servers with appropriate rate limiting.
