# 08 - Mass Game Scraping

## Objective
Execute large-scale scraping of all queued NBA games, extracting and storing JSON data from NBA.com's `#__NEXT_DATA__` sections for approximately 30,000 games.

## Background
With a complete URL queue established, this phase focuses on the systematic execution of scraping operations while maintaining data quality, system reliability, and respectful web scraping practices.

## Scope
- **Target**: All queued games from 1996-97 to 2024-25
- **Data extraction**: Complete JSON from `#__NEXT_DATA__` script tags
- **Storage**: Raw JSON preservation with metadata
- **Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and error handling

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Scraping Infrastructure
1. **Multi-threaded scraping engine**
   - Configurable worker threads (2-4 concurrent)
   - Rate limiting between requests (1-2 seconds)
   - Queue-based work distribution

2. **Data storage strategy**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE raw_game_data (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       game_id VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       game_url TEXT NOT NULL,
       raw_json JSONB NOT NULL,
       scraped_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
       json_size INTEGER,
       processing_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'raw'
   );
   ```

3. **Progress tracking system**
   - Real-time queue status updates
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error categorization and reporting

### Phase 2: Scraping Execution Strategy
1. **Chronological processing**
   - Start with oldest seasons (1996-97)
   - Progress through to current season
   - Season-based checkpointing

2. **Batch processing approach**
   - Process 100-500 games per batch
   - Commit progress after each batch
   - Enable pause/resume functionality

3. **Error handling hierarchy**
   - Transient errors: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Rate limiting: Dynamic delay adjustment
   - Permanent failures: Mark for manual review

### Phase 3: Data Quality Assurance
1. **JSON validation**
   - Structure verification on extraction
   - Key field presence validation
   - Data completeness scoring

2. **Content verification**
   - Play-by-play data presence
   - Box score completeness
   - Game metadata accuracy

## Technical Implementation

### Scraping Engine Components
1. **Queue manager**
   ```python
   class GameScrapingQueue:
       def get_next_batch(self, batch_size=100):
           # Return next batch of pending games
       
       def mark_in_progress(self, game_ids):
           # Update status to prevent duplicate processing
       
       def mark_completed(self, game_id, json_data):
           # Store results and update status
       
       def mark_failed(self, game_id, error_info):
           # Log failure and schedule retry if appropriate
   ```

2. **Data extractor**
   ```python
   class NBADataExtractor:
       def extract_game_data(self, url):
           # Fetch page and extract __NEXT_DATA__ JSON
       
       def validate_json_structure(self, json_data):
           # Verify expected data structure
       
       def calculate_completeness_score(self, json_data):
           # Assess data quality and completeness
   ```

3. **Rate limiter**
   ```python
   class RateLimiter:
       def __init__(self, requests_per_second=0.5):
           # Conservative rate limiting
       
       def wait_if_needed(self):
           # Enforce rate limits between requests
       
       def handle_rate_limit_response(self, response):
           # Dynamic backoff on 429 responses
   ```

### Monitoring and Reporting
1. **Real-time dashboard metrics**
   - Games processed per hour
   - Success/failure rates
   - Queue remaining count
   - Estimated completion time

2. **Error categorization**
   - Network timeouts
   - Rate limiting responses
   - Missing JSON data
   - Invalid JSON structure
   - Server errors (5xx)

3. **Progress checkpoints**
   - Season completion markers
   - Daily progress reports
   - Performance trend analysis

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
1. **Memory optimization**
   - Stream processing for large JSON
   - Garbage collection tuning
   - Connection pooling

2. **Database optimization**
   - Bulk insert operations
   - Index strategy for lookups
   - Connection pool sizing

3. **Network optimization**
   - Keep-alive connections
   - Compression handling
   - DNS caching

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Horizontal scaling readiness**
   - Stateless scraping workers
   - Shared queue coordination
   - Distributed progress tracking

2. **Cloud deployment options**
   - AWS EC2 spot instances
   - Auto-scaling based on queue size
   - S3 storage for JSON data

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Automatic Recovery
1. **Retry policies**
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s intervals
   - Maximum 3 retries for transient errors
   - Different retry schedules by error type

2. **Queue management**
   - Failed games return to queue with delay
   - Priority adjustment for retried games
   - Permanent failure threshold (5 attempts)

### Manual Intervention
1. **Error analysis tools**
   - Failed game inspection utilities
   - Error pattern identification
   - Manual requeue capabilities

2. **Data validation tools**
   - JSON structure analysis
   - Data completeness reports
   - Quality score distributions

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Completion rate**: 98%+ of queued games
- **Data quality**: 95%+ complete JSON structures
- **Performance**: 500-1000 games per day
- **Error rate**: <2% permanent failures

### Quality Indicators
- Play-by-play data present in 99%+ of games
- Box score completeness 99%+
- Game metadata accuracy 99.5%+
- JSON structure consistency across seasons

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **NBA.com blocking**: Conservative rate limiting, user agent rotation
2. **Server capacity**: Cloud scaling, resource monitoring
3. **Data corruption**: Validation at extraction, backup storage
4. **Process interruption**: Checkpoint system, resume capabilities

### Operational Risks
1. **Long processing time**: Parallel processing, progress monitoring
2. **Storage capacity**: Cloud storage scaling, compression
3. **Cost management**: Spot instances, storage optimization
