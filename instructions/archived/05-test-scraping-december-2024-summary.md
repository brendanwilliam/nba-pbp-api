# Test Scraping December 2024 - Summary

## Completed: June 14, 2025

### What Was Done

1. **Test Setup and Configuration**
   - Created comprehensive test script (`src/scrapers/test_december_2024.py`)
   - Configured detailed logging to track all operations
   - Set up performance metrics collection

2. **URL Collection**
   - Successfully scraped game URLs from December 1-4, 2024
   - Collected exactly 30 games as planned
   - NBA.com schedule pages returned games without issues

3. **Data Scraping**
   - Scraped all 30 games successfully (100% success rate)
   - Average scraping time: 3.15 seconds per game
   - Total time for 30 games: 94.57 seconds
   - All games contained complete `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON

4. **Data Validation**
   - All 30 games have complete play-by-play data
   - JSON structure is consistent across all games
   - No parsing errors or data issues found
   - Data stored successfully in PostgreSQL database

### Key Findings

1. **Performance**
   - Current 2-second delay between requests is appropriate
   - No rate limiting or blocking from NBA.com
   - Estimated time for 1000 games: ~53 minutes
   - Estimated time for full historical scraping (~30,000 games): ~26 hours

2. **Data Quality**
   - JSON structure from `__NEXT_DATA__` is reliable
   - Contains comprehensive game data including:
     - Play-by-play events
     - Box scores
     - Player statistics
     - Game metadata
   - Structure has remained consistent across test games

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Scraping queue system works effectively
   - Error handling and retry logic functions properly
   - Database storage is efficient

### Recommendations

1. **Ready for Full-Scale Scraping**
   - 100% success rate exceeds the 95% target
   - Performance is excellent with current configuration
   - No adjustments needed to scraping logic

2. **Next Steps**
   - Proceed with systematic scraping plan (Plan 06)
   - Consider implementing parallel scraping for faster completion
   - Set up monitoring for long-running scraping jobs

### Technical Details

- Test games were from the 2024-25 season
- Games included various team matchups
- JSON data sizes ranged from ~1-3MB per game
- All data successfully stored in `raw_game_data` table
