# 06 - Systematic Scraping Plan (1996-97 to 2024-25)

## Objective
Create a comprehensive, systematic plan to scrape all NBA games from the 1996-97 season through the 2024-25 season, covering approximately 30,000+ games.

## Background
Following successful testing on December 2024 games, we need a robust strategy to handle historical data scraping at scale while managing:
- Rate limiting and respectful scraping practices
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Progress tracking and resumption capabilities
- Data storage and organization

## Scope
- **Seasons**: 1996-97 through 2024-25 (28+ seasons)
- **Games**: ~30,000 total games (regular season + playoffs)
- **Data**: Play-by-play, box scores, game metadata
- **Timeline**: Phased approach over several weeks

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Season-by-Season Approach
1. **Chronological order**: Start with 1996-97, progress to present
2. **Batch processing**: Process one season at a time
3. **Checkpoint system**: Save progress after each completed season
4. **Validation**: Verify data completeness before proceeding

### Phase 2: Game Discovery and URL Generation
1. **Schedule data collection**
   - NBA.com historical schedules
   - Game ID patterns by season
   - Team abbreviation mapping

2. **URL generation strategy**
   - Pattern: `nba.com/game/{away_team}-vs-{home_team}-{game_id}`
   - Validate URL accessibility before queuing
   - Handle URL format changes across seasons

### Phase 3: Queue Management System
1. **Database queue structure**
   - Game metadata (date, teams, season, game_id)
   - Scraping status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
   - Retry count and error tracking
   - Priority scoring (recent games first)

2. **Queue processing logic**
   - Parallel processing with rate limiting
   - Failed game retry mechanism
   - Progress monitoring and reporting

### Phase 4: Scraping Execution Framework
1. **Rate limiting strategy**
   - 1-2 requests per second to NBA.com
   - Exponential backoff on errors
   - Respect robots.txt and terms of service

2. **Error handling**
   - Network timeouts and retries
   - HTTP error code handling
   - Missing data detection
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Data validation**
   - JSON structure verification
   - Play-by-play completeness checks
   - Box score data validation
   - Duplicate detection

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
- Enhanced queue management system
- Robust error handling and logging
- Progress monitoring dashboard
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Week 3-4: Historical Seasons (1996-2010)
- Process 14 seasons (~11,000 games)
- Focus on data structure consistency
- Handle legacy NBA.com format changes
- Validate historical accuracy

### Week 5-6: Modern Seasons (2010-2020)
- Process 10 seasons (~8,000 games)
- Improved data quality and completeness
- Enhanced play-by-play detail
- Advanced statistics availability

### Week 7-8: Recent Seasons (2020-2025)
- Process 5 seasons (~4,000 games)
- Current NBA.com format
- Complete feature set
- Real-time validation possible

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema for Queue Management
```sql
CREATE TABLE scraping_queue (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    season VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    game_date DATE NOT NULL,
    home_team VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    away_team VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    game_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    error_message TEXT
);
```

### Performance Targets
- **Throughput**: 500-1000 games per day
- **Success rate**: 98%+ completion
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Data quality**: 99%+ play-by-play completeness

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- NBA.com rate limiting or blocking
- Website structure changes
- Server capacity limitations
- Data storage constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
- Conservative rate limiting
- Multiple scraping strategies
- Incremental data storage
- Cloud storage scaling

## Monitoring and Reporting
- Daily progress reports
- Error rate tracking
- Data quality metrics
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Success Criteria
- 98%+ of games successfully scraped
- Complete play-by-play data for successful scrapes
- Organized data storage by season
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- Scalable process for future seasons

## Dependencies
- Successful completion of Plan 05 (test scraping)
- Enhanced database schema for queue management
- Robust error handling infrastructure
- Sufficient storage capacity

## Next Steps
After completion:
1. Data quality assessment across all seasons
2. Database schema optimization based on collected data
3. Preparation for JSON analysis (Plan 09)
